(*
 * Returns true if the argument at the supplied index location of the 
 * inductive property (which should be at relative index 1 before calling
 * this function) is an index to some application of the induction principle
 * in the second term that was not an index to any application of the induction
 * principle in the first term.
 *
 * In other words, this looks for applications of the property
 * in the induction principle type, checks the argument at the location,
 * and determines whether they were equal. If they are ever not equal,
 * then the index is considered to be new. Since we are ornamenting,
 * we can assume that we maintain the same inductive structure, and so
 * we should encounter applications of the induction principle in both
 * terms in exactly the same order.
