B has the same number of constructors in the same order as A ,
I B is not A ,
A and B do not contain recursive references to themselves under products, and
for every recursive reference to A in A , there is exactly one new hypothesis in B , which
is exactly the new index of the corresponding recursive reference in B .*)
