 * This file explains the assumptions from Section 3 in more detail,

 *
 * These assumptions are not core to the type theory or to the
 * original definition of algebraic ornaments. Accordingly, this 
 * file can be viewed as a suite of test cases we'd eventually

(* --- Same number of constructors --- *)

(*
 * We require that B has the same number of constructors as A. 
 * We cannot, for example, find this ornament:
 *)

Inductive vector3 (T : Type) : nat -> Type :=
| nilV3 : vector3 T 0
| consV30 : T -> vector3 T 1
| consV3S : forall (n : nat), T -> vector3 T (S n) -> vector3 T (S (S n)).

Fail Find ornament list vector3 as ltv3.

(*
 * This is not fundamental to the original definition of ornaments.
 * The definition of "same inductive structure" can in fact capture types
 * with different numbers of constructors. 
 *
 * This example isn't minimal; there are other reasons we can't support it yet.
 * But the reason we don't support different numbers of constructors is that
 * it requires search to understand that both consV30 and consV3S corespond to
 * the cons case of a list. That is, that we can combine them to get consV.
 *
 * This is absolutely possible, it is just not done yet.
 *)

(* --- Same order of constructors --- *)

(*
 * We require that B has constructors in the same order as A.
 * We cannot, for example, find this ornament:
 *)

Inductive vector_flip (T : Type) : nat -> Type :=
| consVflip : forall (n : nat), T -> vector_flip T n -> vector_flip T (S n)
| nilVflip : vector_flip T 0.

Fail Find ornament list vector_flip as ltv_flip.

(* 
B has the same number of constructors in the same order as A ,
I B is not A ,
A and B do not contain recursive references to themselves under products, and
for every recursive reference to A in A , there is exactly one new hypothesis in B , which
is exactly the new index of the corresponding recursive reference in B .*)

(* t is well-typed and fully Î· -expanded,

the forgetful direction is similar, with extra restrictions on how B is used within t .*)
